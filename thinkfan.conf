## thinkfan 0.9 example config file
## ================================
##
## ATTENTION: There is only very basic sanity checking on the configuration.
## That means you can set your temperature limits as insane as you like. You
## can do anything stupid, e.g. turn off your fan when your CPU reaches 70Â°C.
##
## That's why this program is called thinkfan: You gotta think for yourself.
##
#######################################################################
##
## This file shows how to use sensor-specific temperature limits.
## First of all, you need to specify temperature inputs. On a Thinkpad, you can
## just use:
##
tp_thermal /proc/acpi/ibm/thermal  # provides us with 16 temperature inputs

##
## On other systems, you have to specify a file in /sys/class/hwmon for each
## sensor you want to use. They are numbered in their order of appearance.
## For example:
#
# hwmon /sys/class/hwmon5/temp2_input           #1
# hwmon /sys/class/hwmon0/device/temp3_input    #2
#
## If you want to read temperatures directly from the hard disk, thinkfan needs
## to be compiled with -DUSE_ATASMART. Then you can do:
#
# atasmart /dev/sda                             #3
# ...
#
## You can have as many temperature inputs as you like. You should at get the
## temperature from the CPU, the GPU and the hard disk.
#

#
## Next we specify the fan we want to use. On a Thinkpad, this is:
#
tp_fan /proc/acpi/ibm/fan

#
## On anything other than a Thinkpad you'll probably use some PWM control file
## in /sys/class/hwmon. Remember that fan levels range from 0 to 255 and that
## they're just a number, not including the word "level" as seen below.
## A sysfs fan would be specified like this:
#
# pwm_fan /sys/class/hwmon/hwmon2/device/pwm1
#
## But remember you can only have one fan.

#
## Then you need to specify the temperature limits for each of the sensors.
## A dot means that the corresponding sensor should be ignored. The length of the
## UPPER and LOWER limits must be the same as the number of temperatures. In this
## example, /proc/acpi/ibm/thermal contains 16 sensors (on older thinkpads,
## there may be only 8), some of which are unused (hence the dots).
## A sysfs temperature input always contains only one sensor, so if you specify
## 5 sysfs files above, the length of your limits must be 5, too.
#
## I've come up with these preliminary settings for my Thinkpad T61p. They probably
## don't make sense for anything else, so you most definitely have to work
## something out for yourself.

{ "level 0"   # the fan level
# ^-------^   This works for /proc/acpi/ibm/thermal.
#             for a PWM fan in /sys/class/hwmon it would have to be just
#             0 or "0".
#
#    Sensor count:
#    1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10 11 12 13 14 15 16
#    ==============================================
